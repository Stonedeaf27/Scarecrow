## Features

### Real-Time Crop Price Data
Scarecrow provides farmers with up-to-date market prices for various crops, helping them make informed selling decisions.

### Automated Irrigation and Fertilization
Sensors planted in the field monitor soil moisture and water requirements. The app uses this data, along with weather forecasts from the OpenWeather API, to automatically adjust irrigation schedules and fertilization needs.

### Weather Tracking
Integration with the OpenWeather API allows Scarecrow to provide accurate weather forecasts. The app adjusts irrigation settings based on predicted rainfall, optimizing water usage.

### Agricultural Encyclopedia
Scarecrow includes a comprehensive directory of growing methods for various crops, herbs, and more. It offers seasonal guidelines for planting and harvesting, providing farmers with valuable knowledge.

### Equipment Marketplace
Farmers can rent or buy farming and harvesting equipment through the app's integrated marketplace, making it easier to access necessary tools.

### Farming News Updates
The NEWS API integration ensures farmers stay informed about the latest agricultural news, trends, and events, supporting their decision-making process.

### Offline Data Storage
Scarecrow caches important agricultural data to ensure accessibility in areas with limited internet connectivity, addressing a common challenge in rural regions.

## Technologies Used
- **FlutterFlow**: A no-code platform for building the application.
- **OpenWeather API**: For weather forecasting and adjustments.
- **NEWS API**: To provide the latest farming-related news.
- **Sensor Integration**: For real-time soil moisture and irrigation data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK
- A FlutterFlow account
- API keys for OpenWeather and NEWS API

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Stonedeaf27/scarecrow.git
    cd scarecrow
    ```

2. Set up your Flutter environment:
    Follow the instructions on the [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to install Flutter on your machine.

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4. Configure API keys:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
    ```
    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
    NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key
    ```

5. Run the app:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Usage

1. **Dashboard**: View real-time crop prices, weather forecasts, and the latest news.
2. **Irrigation Control**: Monitor and adjust irrigation settings based on sensor data and weather forecasts.
3. **Encyclopedia**: Access detailed information on various crops and farming methods.
4. **Marketplace**: Rent or buy farming equipment.
5. **Offline Mode**: Continue accessing crucial data even without internet connectivity.

## Challenges
One of the main challenges was ensuring functionality in areas with limited internet connectivity. This was addressed by implementing offline data caching to store important agricultural data locally.

## Future Plans
- **Cattle Tracking**: Implement features to monitor and manage livestock.
- **Plant Disease Detection**: Develop tools to identify and treat plant diseases using image recognition and other methods.
